
Objects and Classes


Everything in C# is asscoaited with classes and objects, along with it's mehtods and attributes
For example: a car is a class and has attributes such as weight and color and methods such as drive and break

    // create a new class named "car"
    public class car
    {
      public int weight { get; set; }
      public string color { get; set; }
      public string make { get; set; }
      public string model { get; set; }
    }

    
Objects are created from a class
You need to create an object from a class before you can populate it with data/values
To create an object, specify the class name "car" followed by your object name "mycar" and the "new" keyword
    car mycarobject = new(); // create an object named "mycarobject" from the class named "car"


    
Populate your new class object attributes with data/values
Specify the new object name and the attribute name as defined in the "car" class
    mycarobject.weight = 300;
    mycarobject.color = "white";
    mycarobject.make = "ford";
    mycarobject.model = "f150";

    
Could also do this as one step
    // create an object named "mycarobject" from the class named "car"
    // populate your new class object attributes with data/values
    car mycarobject = new()
    {
      weight = 300,
      color = "white",
      make = "ford",
      model = "f150"
    };

    
To access the attributes of your "car" class, specify the object name and the attribute
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(mycarobject.weight);
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(mycarobject.color);
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(mycarobject.make);
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(mycarobject.model);
